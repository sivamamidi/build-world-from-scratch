# # Dreams That Last — building an RSSM on a real robot
#
# **Companion notebook for Lecture 4 of *Build a World Model from Scratch* (Vizuara AI).**
#
# In Lecture 3 we built a world model that could predict the next frame almost
# perfectly — and then watched its dream fall apart the moment it had to feed on its
# own predictions. This notebook fixes that, and it does it on **real robot data**:
# 50 tele-operated pick-and-place episodes from an SO-101 arm.
#
# By the end you will have a model that, given five frames of context and then
# **nothing but the joint commands**, imagines two full seconds of robot motion —
# and stays locked to reality the whole way.

#
# ### How to use this notebook
#
# * **Runtime → Run all** works end to end. On a free Colab **GPU** the training
#   section takes about 15 minutes; on CPU, skip training and load our checkpoint
#   (the notebook does this automatically).
# * It is written as a **guide**: each section explains what we are about to do and
#   *why*, then shows the code, then tells you what to look for.
# * Everything downloads itself — the data subset, the trained checkpoint, and the
#   lecture figures. No accounts, no keys, no setup.
#
# ### The three questions (the lecture's structure, kept)
#
# 1. **What does the model track?** Not a state — a *belief*, a distribution over states.
# 2. **How is the machine built?** Two designs that fail, then the one that works: the RSSM.
# 3. **How is it trained?** Two loss terms, and neither one is optional.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup — grab the data, the checkpoint and the figures
#
# We use a 12-episode subset of `lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace` (the full dataset is
# 50 episodes; the last few here are ones the model never trained on, so our
# evaluations stay honest).

#
# ### One row of the dataset — this is a *state*, and this is an *observation*
#
# Lecture 1 taught this distinction abstractly. Here it is, concretely, in one row of
# a real robot dataset. Every timestep stores exactly three things:
#
# | what | shape | meaning |
# |---|---|---|
# | `observation.images.up` | 64 × 64 × 3 = 12,288 numbers | what the camera saw |
# | `observation.state` | 6 numbers | the arm's true joint angles |
# | `action` | 6 numbers | the joint commands that were sent |
#
# **The state is six numbers. The observation is twelve thousand** — pixels pointed
# *at* those six numbers, plus a cube, a table, and lighting the robot does not
# control. A world model's job is to recover the small thing from the huge one.

# ## Part 2 · The machine
#
# ### Design A — one vector, carried forward, never sampled
#
# This is Lecture 3's model. An encoder squeezes the frame; a GRU holds **one
# vector** and updates it from (that vector, the frame, the action); a decoder
# paints the next frame from it. Every arrow is a computation — nothing is sampled.
#
# ![design A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RajatDandekar/build-a-world-model-from-scratch/main/lecture-04-dreams-that-last/assets/fig_designA_arch.png)
#
# **Its strength:** facts loaded into that vector survive indefinitely, because no
# noise ever touches them. We will *measure* this below rather than assert it.
#
# **Its ceiling:** at the fork above, it must output one number. Under squared error
# the safest single answer is the *average* of the possible futures — half-gripped,
# half-slipped, a frame that never occurs. (Measured on our robot: 60-step joint
# error **0.409**.)
#
# ### Design B — sample the state instead
#
# So make the state a **draw from a distribution**: the network outputs a centre and
# a width, and the state is sampled from it. Now a two-answer question can get two
# answers — each one sharp and physically plausible, instead of one blur.
#
# ![the dice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RajatDandekar/build-a-world-model-from-scratch/main/lecture-04-dreams-that-last/assets/fig_dice_futures.png)
#
# **Its ceiling:** if the state is redrawn every timestep, every fact must survive a
# fresh dice roll every step. Fifteen occluded frames is fifteen consecutive rolls.
# It won't. Measured on our robot, this design's joint error *rose* during training
# (0.26 → 0.39) and reached **2.598** over a 60-step dream — the worst of the three.
#
# ### The RSSM — carry both
#
# ![one state, two parts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RajatDandekar/build-a-world-model-from-scratch/main/lecture-04-dreams-that-last/assets/fig_h_and_s.png)
#
# At every timestep the model carries **one state with two halves**:
#
# * **h** (256 numbers) — updated by a GRU, **never sampled**. Facts live here.
# * **s** (32 numbers) — **sampled every step** from a distribution computed *from h*.
#   Doubt lives here.
#
# They are literally concatenated: the decoder receives `[h, s]`, a 288-number
# vector. And they feed each other — the memory decides how uncertain to be, and the
# sample flows into the next memory, so **a doubt once resolved becomes a remembered
# fact**. That last property is what keeps a dream self-consistent.

# ## Part 3 · How do you train this?
#
# Here is the difficulty: **the dataset contains no state labels.** Nowhere in those
# rows is a column saying "the state should be these 288 numbers" — and nobody could
# write one, because the state is the model's own private summary.
#
# So we build the training signal out of two things we *do* have.
#
# ![the training step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RajatDandekar/build-a-world-model-from-scratch/main/lecture-04-dreams-that-last/assets/fig_training_step.png)
#
# ### Loss 1 — repaint the frame
#
# Decode the state back into an image and compare it, pixel by pixel, with what the
# camera actually saw.
#
# *Why we need it:* without this the state could be anything at all, including
# nothing. The only way to repaint the arm, the cube and the table is to have kept
# them. **Loss 1 fills the state with content.**
#
# *Why it is not enough:* Lecture 3 had exactly this term and still failed. A state
# can be perfectly repaintable and still be impossible to roll forward.
#
# ### Loss 2 — ask the same question twice
#
# At each timestep we compute the state **twice**:
#
# * the **posterior** — given the memory, the action, *and the camera frame*
# * the **prior** — given only the memory and the action (this is what dreaming feels like)
#
# **Loss 2 is the distance between those two answers** (a KL divergence between the
# two distributions). Minimise it and you are training the blind guess to match the
# informed one — and there is no way to win that game except to genuinely carry
# forward whatever determines the next frame. That *is* prediction.
#
# And notice it pulls both ways: the posterior is also punished for encoding things
# the prior could never anticipate, so **perception is pushed toward representations
# that are predictable in the first place**. In Lecture 3 we hand-rolled a
# "smoothness" penalty guessing at this principle. Here it falls out of the objective.
#
# > **Loss 1 fills the state. Loss 2 makes what is in it forecastable.** Drop either
# > one and you are back to a model whose dreams dissolve.

# ## Test 1 · What is the belt actually carrying?
#
# People say a recurrent state "carries information forward" and move on. We can do
# better: we can **open the vector and ask it questions**. The technique is a
# *linear probe* and it takes ten lines.
#
# 1. Run the model over episodes and record, at every timestep, the 256-number
#    memory `h` **and** the six true joint angles the robot actually had.
# 2. Fit a single **linear** map from `h` to those angles — no hidden layers. If a
#    plain linear readout can recover a fact, that fact is genuinely *present*.
# 3. Fit the same map against **shuffled** labels as a control. Real structure
#    should score high; the control should score near zero.

# ## What the full ablation showed
#
# In the lecture we went further and trained **three separate models** — same data,
# same 16,000 steps, same seed, matched parameter counts — changing only the state
# design. The code is in `code/modal_ablation.py`; the result:
#
# | design | parameters | pixel error @60 | **joint error @60** |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | deterministic only | 7,718,313 | 0.0106 | **0.409** |
# | stochastic only | 7,543,881 | 0.0155 | **2.598** |
# | **both — the RSSM** | 7,665,993 | **0.0050** | **0.009** |
#
# The RSSM is **45× better than deterministic-only and 288× better than
# stochastic-only** at matched capacity. Note also that pixel error separates the
# three far less than joint error does — pixels are dominated by the static table
# and background, while the *robot* is where the designs actually differ. Always
# check that your metric measures the thing you care about.

# ## What we measured, and what we did not
#
# One claim we expected to make and could not. We predicted that the model's
# **uncertainty would spike at contact** — the grasp is the moment the future
# genuinely forks. Averaged over the state's dimensions, it does not.
#
# What we *did* see is real and worth keeping: at the very first timestep, with no
# history at all, uncertainty is at its maximum — and **one frame collapses it**.
# The belief-narrowing story, measured on a real robot.
#
# Why the contact spike is missing is an open question: either the forks live in a
# few dimensions that the average washes out, or 50 episodes of a reliably
# successful grasp simply contain little for the model to be unsure about. Both are
# testable — see the exercises.

# ## What to take away
#
# 1. **A world model tracks a belief, not a state.** A centre *and* a width. A model
#    that cannot express doubt will invent a confident wrong answer.
# 2. **Two paths, two jobs.** A deterministic memory for facts you are sure of;
#    sampled dice for the moments the world forks. Merge them into one channel and
#    you lose both — we measured 45× and 288× penalties for dropping either.
# 3. **Prediction is taught by asking the same question twice.** With the frame and
#    without it, then pulling the answers together. That single term is what turns an
#    autoencoder into a world model.
# 4. **Train the pieces together.** A representation learned without the prediction
#    task will not survive the prediction task.
#
# ### Exercises
#
# 1. **Break the asymmetry.** Let the prior see the encoded frame too (pass `emb`
#    into `prior_mlp`). Loss 2 will collapse to near zero — and the dream will fall
#    apart. Why is a loss you can trivially minimise a useless loss?
# 2. **Shrink the memory.** Set `H = 32` and retrain. Which test degrades first —
#    the probe, the dream, or the reconstruction?
# 3. **Remove the stochastic path** (`S = 0`, decoder reads `h` alone). Reproduce the
#    deterministic-only arm of the ablation and check you get roughly 0.4.
# 4. **Hunt the missing spike.** Instead of averaging the width over all 32
#    dimensions, plot the *per-dimension* width around the grasp. Does any single
#    dimension spike at contact?
# 5. **Dream past 60 steps.** Push the horizon to 200. Where does it finally break,
#    and what breaks first — the arm, or the cube?
